                    <h2>Hydrangeas</h2>
                    <img src="assets\forever_pink_resized.jpg" alt="Hydrangeas Flower" class="content-image"/>
                    <p>
                        The meaning of hydrangeas will depend on who you ask. In Japanese culture, they are associated with heartfelt emotion, gratitude and apology. This is because, according to legend, a Japanese emperor gave a bunch of hydrangeas to the family of the girl he loved, to apologise for neglecting her, to focus on his work instead, and to show how much he really cared for her.
                        But, in Europe, they have a slightly darker meaning as they symbolise arrogance. With their large petals and eye-catching shape, some tied their meaning to vanity and boastfulness too. And, interestingly, during Medieval times, people believed that women who grew or kept hydrangea would not be able to find a spouse.
                        Thankfully, times have changed, and people don’t generally think that hydrangeas are the reason someone is single. Ironically, they’re now actually used a lot in anniversary flowers and bouquets.

                        Pink tulips are known for meaning affection, caring, good wishes, and love. Although not as deep or passionate love as red tulips represent. Pink tulips are great to send to friends and family members to show them you care. If you want to congratulate someone on a new job, a promotion or graduation, pink tulips say it best!

                    <p>
                        These stunning flowers are believed to mean pride, strength and determination as they stand tall above all other winter blooms. Amaryllis is also a Greek name which means 'to sparkle'. Very in keeping with the festive season when we throw glitter at literally everything.
                        Pink can be seen as romantic but, in most situations it symbolises friendship. Pink amaryllis are the perfect gift to show your friends and family how much they mean to you.
